## **Project Overview**
This project is a culmination of the Market Risk course, aimed at applying theoretical concepts to practical problems in financial risk management. It covers key areas of market risk, including Value at Risk (VaR), Monte Carlo simulations, Extreme Value Theory (EVT), optimal liquidation strategies, and wavelet analysis.

The project is divided into the following tasks:

1. **Value at Risk (VaR)**:  
   - Historical and non-parametric VaR estimation for Natixis stock returns.  
   - Validation of non-parametric VaR using out-of-sample data.

2. **Monte Carlo VaR for Options**:  
   - Estimation of the VaR for a call option using simulated stock prices derived from a Brownian motion.

3. **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**:  
   - Analysis of extreme gains and losses using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and estimation of the extremal index.

4. **Optimal Liquidation Strategies**:  
   - Implementation of the Almgren and Chriss model for asset liquidation under constraints.

5. **Wavelet Analysis and Hurst Exponent**:  
   - Multiresolution correlation analysis of FX rates using Haar wavelets.  
   - Estimation of the Hurst exponent to capture long-term memory effects and volatility scaling.
